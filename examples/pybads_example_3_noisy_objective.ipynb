    "PyBADS is able to optimize also *noisy* objective functions. A noisy (or stochastic) objective function is an objective that will return different results if evaluated twice at the same point $\\mathbf{x}$. Conversely, a non-noisy objective function is known as noiseless or deterministic. For example, noisy objectives are common in model fitting when the model is evaluated through simulation (e.g., via sampling aka Monte Carlo methods).\n",

    "For this example, we take as target a quadratic function and we add i.i.d. Gaussian noise to it (*noisy sphere*). In a real case, the noise would arise from some stochastic process in the calculation of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also set here several `options` for the optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We tell `bads` that the target is noisy by activating the `uncertainty_handling` option. This is not strictly needed, as `bads` can automatically detect if a target is noisy, but it is good practice to specify.\n",
    "- We also limit the number of function evaluations with `max_fun_evals`, knowing that this is a simple example. Generally, `bads` will tend to run for longer on noisy problems to better explore the noisy landscape.\n",
    "- Finally, we tell `bads` to re-evaluate the target at the returned solution with 100 samples via `noise_final_samples` (by default, `noise_final_samples = 10`, but since our function is inexpensive we can use more evaluations). These evaluations count towards the total budget of function evaluations `max_fun_evals`."

    "### Remarks\n",
    "    \n",
    "- While PyBADS can handle noisy targets, it cannot handle arbitrarily large noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- PyBADS will work best if the *standard deviation* of the objective function $\\sigma$, when evaluated in the vicinity of the global solution, is small with respect to changes in the objective function itself (that is, there is a good signal-to-noise ratio). In many cases, $\\sigma \\approx 1$ or less should work (this is the default assumption). If you approximately know the magnitude of the noise in the vicinity of the solution, you can help BADS by specifying it in advance (set `options[\"noise_size\"] = sigma_est`, where `sigma_est` is your estimate of the standard deviation).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the noise around the solution is too large, PyBADS will perform poorly. In that case, we recommend to increase the precision of your computation of the objective (e.g., by drawing more Monte Carlo samples) such that $\\sigma \\approx 1$ or even lower, as needed by your problem. Note that the noise farther away from the solution can be larger, and this is usually okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this example, we assumed the amount of noise in each target evaluation is unknown. If instead you *can* estimate the magnitude of the noise for each evaluation, see the next example.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For more information on optimizing noisy objective functions, see the BADS wiki: https://github.com/acerbilab/bads/wiki#noisy-objective-function (this link points to the MATLAB wiki, but many of the questions and answers apply to PyBADS as well).\n"
