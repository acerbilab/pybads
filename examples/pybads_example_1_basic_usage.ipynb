    "## 0. What is (Py)BADS?\n",
    "\n",
    "BADS is a fast hybrid Bayesian optimization algorithm designed to solve difficult optimization problems, in particular related to parameter estimation -- aka model fitting -- of computational models (e.g., via maximum-likelihood or maximum-a-posteriori estimation). **PyBADS is its Python implementation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "BADS has been intensively tested for fitting a variety of computational models, and is currently used by many research groups around the world (see [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?cites=7209174494000095753&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en) for many example applications). In our benchmark with real model-fitting problems, BADS performed on par or better than many other common and state-of-the-art optimizers, as shown in the [original BADS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04405).\n",
    "\n",
    "BADS is particularly recommended when:\n",
    "- the objective function landscape is rough (nonsmooth), typically due to numerical approximations or noise;\n",
    "- the objective function is moderately expensive to compute (e.g., more than 0.1 second per function evaluation);\n",
    "- the gradient is unavailable;\n",
    "- the number of input parameters is up to about `D = 20` or so.\n",
    "\n",
    "BADS requires no specific tuning and runs off-the-shelf like other built-in Python optimizers (e.g., from `scipy.optimize.minimize`).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: If you are interested in estimating posterior distributions (i.e., uncertainty and error bars) over model parameters, and not just point estimates, you might also want to check out [Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo for Python (PyVBMC)](https://github.com/acerbilab/pyvbmc), a package for Bayesian posterior and model inference which can be used in synergy with PyBADS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the goal of BADS is to *minimize* a target (or objective) function $f(\\mathbf{x}): \\mathbb{R}^D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, for $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$,\n",

    "- Hard lower/upper bounds `lower_bounds`, `upper_bounds` are the actual optimization bounds; PyBADS will not evaluate the target function outside these bounds, but might evaluate the target on the bounds. You can use `-np.inf` and `np.inf` for unbounded parameters.\n",
    "- Plausible lower/upper bounds `plausible_lower_bounds`, `plausible_upper_bounds` represent our best guess at bounding the region where the solution might lie.
