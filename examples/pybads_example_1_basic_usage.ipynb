    "## 0. What is (Py)BADS?\n",
    "\n",
    "BADS is a fast hybrid Bayesian optimization algorithm designed to solve difficult optimization problems, in particular related to parameter estimation -- aka model fitting -- of computational models (e.g., via maximum-likelihood or maximum-a-posteriori estimation). **PyBADS is its Python implementation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "BADS has been intensively tested for fitting a variety of computational models, and is currently used by many research groups around the world (see [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?cites=7209174494000095753&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en) for many example applications). In our benchmark with real model-fitting problems, BADS performed on par or better than many other common and state-of-the-art optimizers, as shown in the [original BADS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04405).\n",
    "\n",
    "BADS is particularly recommended when:\n",
    "- the objective function landscape is rough (nonsmooth), typically due to numerical approximations or noise;\n",
    "- the objective function is moderately expensive to compute (e.g., more than 0.1 second per function evaluation);\n",
    "- the gradient is unavailable;\n",
    "- the number of input parameters is up to about `D = 20` or so.\n",
    "\n",
    "BADS requires no specific tuning and runs off-the-shelf like other built-in optimizers (e.g., from `scipy.optimize.minimize`).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: If you are interested in estimating posterior distributions (i.e., uncertainty and error bars) over model parameters, and not just point estimates, you might also want to check out Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo for Python (PyVBMC), a package for Bayesian posterior and model inference which can be used in synergy with PyBADS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the goal of BADS is to *minimize* a target (or objective) function $f(\\mathbf{x}): \\mathbb{R}^D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, for $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$,\n",
    "$$\n",

    "- Hard lower/upper bounds `lb`, `ub` are the actual optimization bounds; PyBADS will not evaluate the target function outside these bounds, but might evaluate the target on the bounds. You can use `-np.inf` and `np.inf` for unbounded parameters.\n",
    "- Plausible lower/upper bounds `plb`, `pub` represent our best guess at bounding the region where the solution might lie. The plausible bounds do not change the optimization problem, but help define the initial exploration and hyperparameters of PyBADS.\n",
