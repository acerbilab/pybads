============
BADS options
============
The options can be divided into two types:
    - **Basic options:** These options are of interest to most users, and cover all regular usage needs.
    - **Advanced options:** These options should rarely if ever be touched and are reserved to advanced users / developers of BADS. Please do not modify them unless you *know* what you are doing.

You can find the default options for both groups below.

Basic options
=====================
We expect these options to be routinely changed by many users.

.. include:: ./../../../../pybads/bads/option_configs/basic_bads_options.ini

Advanced Options
=====================
These options are reserved to advanced users / developers of BADS. 
We strongly advise against changing these options, unless you know what you are doing, since unexpected/untested behavior might follow.

.. include:: ./../../../../pybads/bads/option_configs/advanced_bads_options.ini
