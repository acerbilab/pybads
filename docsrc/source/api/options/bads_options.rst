============
BADS options
============
The options can be divided into two types of options:
    - **Basic default options:** We expect that these options are changed by many users.
    - **Advanced options:** These options are for advanced users of BADS. Do not modify them unless you *know* what you are doing.

You can find the default options for both groups below.
