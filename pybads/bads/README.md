# BADS subpackage developing notes

These notes are used for keeping track of ToDos and porting information.

## _init_optim_state
Mesh and poll bounds needed to be defined using force2grid.
*integervars* (Integer variables index) is not used and not useful in bads.

In case ignoring warnings for inf in numpy have a look at 519th line code of pyvbmc


## variables transformer 
Might introduce a class for holding the information about the parameters transformation.
